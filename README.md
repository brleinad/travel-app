# Travel App Project

This is the final project for the Udacity front end nanodegree program.
Given a city as a destination and a date the app will provide a picture of the destination and the weather forecast.

This project uses 3 free APIs to get all the information
1. [geonames](https://www.geonames.org/): For an accurate location given the user's input.
2. [weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/): For the weather once the location is set.
3. [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/): For getting pictures for the given location.


## Getting it up and running
```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

And if you will be developing you can also do
```
npm run dev
```
